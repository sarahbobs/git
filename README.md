## A take-home exercise: the WiD Poem Repository

In this take-home exercise you will be contributing to the WiD Github account by adding your very own poem to our poem repository!

The goal of the exercise is to practice how to make pull requests to remote repositories.

We will only give general instructions, so that you can put in practice what you have learned, or make some research. Please contact us if you need help or you have any doubts!

#### Instructions

* Fork our repository.
* Clone it to have the files locally.
* Create your own branch 
* Add a file with your poem to the *WiD Poems* folder (it does not need to be a beautiful poem... or even a poem)
* Add the file and commit the changes
* Push the changes to your repo
* Create a pull request
* We will accept it and you will see your poem in our repository!
